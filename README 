README - Documentation for Demery Gijsbers' Final Project -SI364

This project takes JSON data from the Dog CEO API to send emails to a user with a picture of new dog every day. 

The database used that will need to be created is titled "demgijsfinal" and the title of the project is "final" so to run is: python final.py runserver 

This will open a form on the localhost for a user to enter a username for "Dog-A-Day", the kind of dog they would like to see (either a random dog, or a dog of a certain breed) and their email address so that they are emailed the picture. 

One thing the API told me to install that I believe should be installed in order to run it correctly is "pip install php" for the pictures. 

The emails are sent from my ADMIN account, and a user may only set up one account per email address.
